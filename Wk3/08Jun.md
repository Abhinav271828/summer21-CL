## Homonymy
The same word can have different parts of speech, with different meanings: _sona_ in Hindi, _ceppu_ in Telugu, etc.  

## Part-Of-Speech Tagging
It is an important step to disambiguate words with more meanings than one.  

Supervised taggers typically rely on pre-tagged corpora to servea s the basis for creating any tools to be used throughout the tagging process.  

Rule-based approaches use context to determine tags.
