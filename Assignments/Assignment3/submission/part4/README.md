## Notation
The start state in all FSTs is marked $S_0$. The state which one reaches after getting the root is called $R$. States with a double outline are accepting states.  

On each arc, the notation followed is `input : output`. For example, `fut : vuM` indicates that in the future tense, the suffix -vuM is to be added.  

By convention, Îµ denotes an empty or null affix.  

The various short forms used are:

* `hab`: habitual (aspect)
* `perf`: perfective (aspect)
* `sim`: simple (aspect)
* `cont`: continuous/progressive (aspect)
* `imp`: imperative (mood)
* `as`: assertive (mood)
* `pot`: potential (mood)
* `ob`: obligative (mood)
* `past`: past (tense)
* `pres`: present (tense)
* `fut`: future (tense)
