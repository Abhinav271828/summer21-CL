## Parsing (contd.)
### Chunk Tags
Sometimes, chunks (instead of nouns) can be tagged with PoS tags. For example, _bahuwa sunxara-sI_ is an adjective chunk or JJP.  

Thus, basic parsing involves chunking, PoS tagging and basic morph analysis.

### Syntactic Representation
The syntactic analysis of a sentence can be represented in many ways: rules, FSTs, trees, etc.

## Semantics
All words have some semantic properties. They can be represented using the idea of semantic features (through a form of componential analysis).  

In the case of nouns, components like `physical` or `living` allow us to filter out nonsense combinations like _happy pencil_, _table eats_ or _green ideas_.  

For verbs, case frames show the semantic contexts in which they can occur. Case frames are sometimes represented by predicate calculus.  

These semantic properties enable selectional restrictions to resolve ambiguity in sentences like _The dishwasher read the article._
