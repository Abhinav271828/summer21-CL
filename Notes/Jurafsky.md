# 2 Regular Expressions, Text Normalisation, Edit Distance
Regular expressions are the most important tool for describing text patterns.  
Text normalisation is the process of converting text to a more standard form: for example, tokenisation (splitting up text into words), lemmatisation (identifying common roots) or stemming (removing suffixes), and sentence segmentation (splitting up text into sentences).  
Edit distance is a metric that measures how similar two strings are.  

## 2.1 Regular Expressions
Formally, a regular expression is an algebraic notation for characterising a set of strings. They are useful for searching in texts.  

### 2.1.1 Basic Regular Expression Patterns
The simplest kind of regular expression is just a sequence of characters, like `/woodchuck/` [slashes are not part of expressions]. Regexes are case sensitive.  

We can use braces, which indicate disjunctions, to solve this issue. To match both _woodchucks_ and _Woodchucks_, we can use `/[wW]oodchucks/`.  
Ranges can be specified using the hyphen; e.g. `/[A-Z]/` matches any uppercase letter.  

A caret in the _beginning_ of the square braces expression can be used to specify a "negative" pattern: what the character shouldn't be. Thus `/[^0-9]/` matches any character that is not a number (the caret negates the entire expression inside the brackets).  

A question marks indicates "the previous character or nothing"; for instance `/woodchucks?/` matches _woodchuck_ and _woodchucks_.  

The Kleene star or asterisk allows us to match _zero or more_ occurrences of a character. Therefore `/a*/` matches any string of 0 or more _a_'s. Similarly, `/aa*/` matches one or more _a_'s; `/[ab]*/` matches all strings consisting only of _a_'s and _b_'s; and so on.  
One useful example is `/[0-9][0-9]*/`, which matches any nonnegative integer.  
For convenience, the Kleene plus can be used to indicate one or more occurences; thus `/[0-9]+/`.  

The period is a wildcard expression that matches any single character _except_ a carriage return. Therefore `/beg.n/` matches _begin_, _begun_, _began_, etc.  
`/.*/` is used often and means "any string of characters".  

Anchors are special characters that indicate where in a string we wish the regex to match. The caret indicates the beginning and the dollar indicates the end. Thus `/^The/` matches _The_ if it's the first word, and `/ $/` matches a space at the end of a line.  
Other anchors are `\b` for a word boundary, and `\B` for a non-boundary. A word is defined as any sequence of digits, letters or underscores.  

### 2.1.2 Disjunction, Grouping and Precedence
The disjunction operators for strings is the pipe; thus `/cat|dog/` matches either _cat_ or _dog_.  

Precedence is overridden using ordinary parentheses, as in `/gupp(y|ies)/`, which matches _guppy_ and _guppies_.  
Note that the Kleene star matches only the preceding character, and therefore needs parens to cover an entire regex. Therefore `/(Column [0-9]+ *)*/` matches any repetition of the word _Column_, followed by a space and an integer, followed by any number of spaces.  

The precedence order for operators is `() > *,+,?,{} > ^,seqs > |`.  

To avoid ambiguity, regexes are defined to match greedily: they match the largest possible string. However, the `?` qualifier can be used to enforce non-greedy matching.  

### 2.1.3 A Simple Example
To match all occurrences of _the_, we could say `/the/`; but it won't match _The_.  
`/[tT]he/` would, but it would match part of _theology_ also.  
`/\b[tT]he\b/` wouldn't, but words aren't defined the same.  
`/[^a-zA-Z][tT]he[^a-zA-Z]/` would work, but it would only match if there was some character preceding _the_, and some character following it.  
`/(^|[^a-zA-Z])[tT]he([^a-zA-Z]|$)/` would work.  

The above procedure illustrates two efforts in developing speech and language processing systems:

* increasing precision (reducing false +ves), and
* increasing recall (reducing false â€“ves).  

### 2.1.4 A More Complex Example
