## FST-based Morphological Analysers
These are another type of rule-based morph analysers. They are based on finite state automata (FSAs).  
A finite state automaton is an abstract machine that accepts strings. It has a set of states, with one or more accept states. The states are connected by arcs, which we traverse depending on input symbols.
