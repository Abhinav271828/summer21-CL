## Applied Linguistics
In India, core linguistics refers to phonology, morphology, syntax, etc. and applied linguistics typically includes sociolinguistics, lexicography, anthropological linguistics, psycholinguistics, etc. However, in the Western school, these fields come under the "application of linguistics", and applied linguistics refers only to language teaching.  

Linguistics in general is simply the scientific study of human language.
