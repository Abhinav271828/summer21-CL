## Applications
Spell checkers, grammar checkers and word predictors are a common application of these technologies.

## Machine Translation
It is a subfield of computational linguistics that uses computer programs to automatically translate from one language to another.  

A common approach is to translate from the source language to an abstract formal representation, and then to the target language. This allows us to avoid creating a new translation for each pair of languages.

## Methods
1. Rule-based
2. Corpus-based
    This method uses statistics to find equivalents for a word, phrase or sentence from the parallel corpus. The program learns from aligned parallel corpora. 

## Types of MT Systems
1. Dictionary-based  
    This follows the word-for-word translation method, using a dictionary to translate each word.  
2. Statistical  
    This system follows the corpus-based method.  
3. Example-based  
    This essentially follows a translation-by-analogy approach.  
4. Neural networks
    This  model predicts the likelihood of a sequence of words, modelling entire sentences in a single model. 

## Limitations
* It can't translate cultural components of the text.  
* It often generates overly literal output.  
* It cannot recognise idioms or slang if they are not in its memory.  
* It lacks the creativity of human work.
